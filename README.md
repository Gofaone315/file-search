## Overview
This Python script allows users to search for files within a specified directory based on a query. It traverses the given directory and its subdirectories to locate files that match the user's search term.

### How to Use
1. Run the script.
2. Provide the path to the directory you want to search.
3. Enter the name (or part of the name) of the file you're looking for.
4. The script will display any matching files it finds.

### Example
```bash
Enter path to directory: /path/to/directory
Enter name of file you're looking for: example.txt
Searching for 'example.txt' in /path/to/directory
Found example.txt in /path/to/directory/subdirectory
```
